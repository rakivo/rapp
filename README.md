# Quick start
> if you're not on X11, the program won't compile / work for you.
```console
$ rush -t release
```
> if you're not using [rush](https://github.com/rakivo/rush) ... kinda nah but ok do `./build.sh`

> run it
```console
$ ./build/rapp-release
```

# History
> I was not satisfied with the application finder I had, because it did not rank apps by the amount of times I have already launched them with it.

> so I created [rapp](https://github.com/rakivo/rapp/tree/master) as a weekend project, implemented the frequency ranking thing, make it as simple as possible, and made the [`naysayer`](https://github.com/nickav/naysayer-theme.el) theme default, because it's the theme I use in my editor and am comfortable with.
